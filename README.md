# Trends II - The movie database

For this group project, we chose to work on the IT-trend called “low-code programming”, which entails the graphic development of software applications by making use of a graphic user interface (GUI). 

As proof-of-concept (PoC) of this IT-trend, we developed a movie database website with the free low-code platform teleportHQ. On this movie database website, users can look up different movies and TV shows and check the trailer, the audience score and other relevant information about the selected movie/TV show. 

To get the required data of all the movies, an API connection was made with The Movie Database API service. In this way, our website is connected with this database, and it can so retrieve all the requested data about the movies. Finally, to launch our website, we made use of GitHub actions to automate the process of launching the website, and possible changes to it, directly onto the Heroku hosting platform.  
The goal of this project is to show the power of low-code programming and its value in the IT-world. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using this ‘way’ of developing software applications and for what applications is low-code programming best used? With the development of our website, we hope to show the strong and weak points of low-code programming and its usefulness in businesses.
